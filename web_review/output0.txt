"It works really well when there\u2019s a hurricane. Battery life is good. I mostly play on the TV. But you can play anywhere."

"Fun for kids and adult kids \ud83e\udd70"

"Product is great as it should be."

"We bought this for our son before a big move and it was absolutely perfect! We love that it\u2019s small and portable and it\u2019s been super easy for him to use. The set we ordered was perfect and he looks forward to adding more games to his collection."

"Was sons \"asked for\" Christmas gift. It was a hit."

"I got this for my nephew's 12th birthday. He loved the upgrade. The only issue was the instructions were mostly not in English"

"The package came as normal but I got like a japanese manual of like what to do and there was no american so I would say that's the only downside of it. The switch works perfectly and it's fully charged when you get it. Also at first you need to be around strong internet for it to connect first or else the connection won't work very well at first but then it becomes fine. The confusing part about it would probably be having to give a code to the driver that they had sent to you."
