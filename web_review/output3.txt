"Works great! No issues"

"works the same as the original."

"Upon set up, the console did not turn on at all. The console is very dusty inside and pretty beat up. I am very disappointed with this order. It was a pretty expensive order for it to be defected and not function."

"It came as picture and it works as expected... thx."

"Everything was perfect but the controller felt awkward at the touch but the controller does work but it just felt kinda sticky but not really I had to buy a after market controller but I digress the game works well, the seller shipping the item kinda took a long time"

"A little beat up, BUT works perfectly. Saw the negative reviews and giggled ^.^ . More then likely they never used an older childhood device on a new tv. Anywho I'm 27yrs old and live with my bf who's 33yrs old. We love these older systems as we are big kids! Nintendo is my go too or old school arcade games. Works amazing just dont expect it to look like a playstation brand new."

"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and it does in fact work and isn\u2019t region locked ! Awesome purchase ."

"Disc reader doesn't function at all, and when I plugged my controller into my other GameCube it would decide I was holding a few of the buttons down, seemingly at random"
